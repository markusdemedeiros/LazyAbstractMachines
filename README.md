# Deriving Lazy Abstract Machines

Implementations for Peter Sestoft's paper [Deriving a Lazy Abstract Machine](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/deriving-a-lazy-abstract-machine/A1CF974BD4A92A2A9B47287F55B68DB6)

This implementatation is a work in progress and is not yet exactly representative of the machines (Mark I and Mark II) as presented in the paper. However, it does produce the same values for all provided examples up to section 5.
